/// @brief Kea Control Agent Application Process
///
/// RelayProcess provides top level application logic for the Control
/// Agent, a process managing Kea servers.
///
/// The Control Agent receives JSON control commands over HTTP and forwards
/// the JSON commands to the respective Kea servers. The JSON command
/// includes a name of the server to which the command pertains. After
/// receiving a response from the Kea server it is sent back over HTTP
/// to the control API client.
///
/// Some commands are handled by the Control Agent process itself, rather than
/// forwarded to the Kea servers. An example of such command is the one that
/// instructs the agent to start a specific service.

    /// alters configuration. This method must not throw, it should catch any
    /// processing errors and return a success or failure answer as described
    /// below.
    ///
    /// A usual problem related to the system reconfiguration is how to preserve
    /// configuration integrity in case of errors. In this case, when the
    /// HTTP listener's configuration is modified there is a need to close all
    /// existing connections and gracefully shutdown the listener's instance.
    /// This, however, makes it possible that the control agent looses
    /// connectivity if opening a new listener is unsuccessful. In fact, this
    /// is quite possible scenario when the user is setting up the listener to
    /// use a restricted port range or non-existing IP address. In this case,
    /// the configuration parser will not signal the problem because IP address
    /// and/or port are syntactically correct.
    ///
    /// This method deals with this problem by opening a new listener aside of
    /// the currently running listener (if the new listener settings are
    /// different than current settings). Both instances are held until the
    /// RelayProcess::garbageCollectListeners is invoked, which
