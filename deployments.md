# Kea Deployments List  

Have you deployed Kea DHCP successfully in your organization?  

It might be helpful for other potential users to know of organizations who are successfully using Kea. 

If you would like to add yourself to the list, either create a pull request / merge request adding a line to the table below with your information, or add it as a comment on this issue in our issue tracker (https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/-/issues/1231). If both of those options are too much trouble, you could also just email us at info@isc.org and ask to be added to the list.
